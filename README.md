# ![Tatokuro Icon](./app/assets/icons/icon@32x32.png) Tatokuro
Tatokuro is a free and open-source manga reading application for Desktop, heavily inspired by the manga reader for Android, [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi).

## Features
Currently there are no features in Tatokuro, and the application is still heavily in development, but we can still line up expected features for the application, which are also heavily inspired by features from [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi).

Expected features:
* Online reading from sources such as KissManga, MangaDex and more.
* Offline reading of manga downloaded manga.
* Light and dark themes, starting out with a dark theme.
* [AniList](https://anilist.co/) support to start with. Later other lists, such as [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).

## Download
Currently there is no download available for Tatokuro, but if you are a developer, then feel free to compile the application yourself.
